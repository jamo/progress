== Demo of automatic reload with ActionController::Live

BrowserController is the control channel for the browser.  When the page is
loaded, application.js registers an SSE with the browser to watch /control.
/control watches the filesystem for changes.  Whenever a change happens on the
filesystem, an SSE is sent to the browser, telling it to reload.
